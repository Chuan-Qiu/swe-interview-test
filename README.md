## How to Run

### Backend
1. `cd StarterCode/backend`
2. `npm install`
3. (Optional for auto-reload) `npm run dev` or start normally with `npm start`
4. The API runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default. Set `PORT` or `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in a `.env` file if needed.

### Frontend
1. `cd StarterCode/frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` and communicates with the backend at `http://localhost:5000` unless `REACT_APP_API_BASE` is set.
